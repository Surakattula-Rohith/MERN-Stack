    <h3>About Earth:</h3>
    <p>
      Earth is our home planet. Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed
      around the same time as the rest of the solar system. They think that was
      about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the
      solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. And Earth is the
      third-closest planet to the sun

    <h3>Our Moon:</h3>
    <p>
      The Moon (or Luna) is the Earth’s only natural satellite and was formed
      4.6 billion years ago around some 30–50 million years after the formation
      of the solar system. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth
      meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The first uncrewed
      mission to the Moon was in 1959 by the Soviet Lunar Program with the first
      crewed landing being Apollo 11 in 1969.
